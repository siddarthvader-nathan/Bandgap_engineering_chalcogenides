Code to generate data, run cluster expansion models and generate training data for machine learning models to predict chemical order-dependent bandages in ternary chalcogenides. The sine coulomb matrix and Bag of Bonds methods were used for featurization. Bandgaps were  extracted from DFT relaxations and used as targets for ML model training.
